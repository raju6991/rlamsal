Animations shouldn't just be "eye candy"—they should provide feedback and guide the user's attention. In this project, I used **Framer Motion** for layout transitions and **use-sound** for a tactile audio experience.

## Orchestrating Motion

Framer Motion makes it incredibly easy to handle layout changes. By using the `layout` prop, elements smoothly transition to their new positions without manual calculations.

## Bringing Sound to Life

Inspired by modern OS interfaces, I integrated a subtle sound system. Links, buttons, and even toggle switches provide acoustic feedback, making the interface feel more physical.

```tsx
const [play] = useSound('/sounds/pop.mp3');
// ...
<button onClick={() => play()}>Click Me</button>
```
