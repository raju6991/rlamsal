Writing content should be as seamless as writing code. I wanted a CMS that didn't require an external database or service, keeping everything in Git. **Keystatic** was the perfect fit.

## Local-First CMS

Keystatic provides a beautiful UI for editing local Markdown and MDOC files. Since the content lives in the repository, I can branching, PR, and version my blog posts just like my source code.

## Component Blocks

One of the most powerful features of Keystatic is **Component Blocks**. It allows me to embed complex React components directly into my Markdown content, like the Interactive Illustrations you see above.
